        <ul>
            <li>If a team member leaves the game or respawns after the round has begun, the remaining members must finish the round. If all players of one team leave, that round will be given to the opposing team.</li>
            <li>The round does not count if a team member leaves before the round begins, and the match is halted.</li>
            <li>All unavailable players will be unable to play for the remainder of the match if they cause the match to be paused for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Disconnecting due to latency, a player's game crashing, or any other equipment issues (while unpleasant) does not result in a redo and the round will stand.</li>

            <li>From the start of a match, all members get 15 minutes to join a lobby.</li>

            <li>Cancellation of the match must be agreed upon by both parties.</li>
            <li>If your opponent goes afk, only the first round they were afk in will be counted towards your score.</li>
            <li>It is against the rules to respawn mid-round, the opponent will be given that round (Note: Respawning in Zone Wars and Boxfights after one round but before the next round starts is allowed).</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Exploits and two-sided game mechanics that are repeated do not count as game glitches.</li>
            <li>A game crash is not considered a game glitch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Observers</h3>

        <h3>Region</h3>
        <ul>

        <h3>Host </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The chosen host should be given host in the Fortnite lobby, however all rounds played on an incorrect host will stand (as will rounds played on an incorrect map).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Toxicity is against our rules. Although toxicity will never change the outcome of a match, in extreme scenarios we may penalize users. Do NOT claim a win if your opponent is toxic, report them after the match in our Discord. (<a href="https://discord.gg/TavernGaming">discord.gg/TavernGaming</a>)</li>
            <li>If a player's platform or Epic Name is incorrect, the player has 10 minutes from the time a moderator enters the conversation to resolve the situation. The match must be restarted when the player resolves the issue by switching accounts or platforms.</li>

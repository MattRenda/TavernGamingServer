<p>7.2 In order to register, the player must complete a registration form. <br>

It is prohibited to register using extraneous or otherwise inaccurate information.<br> The organizer shall confirm receipt of the details submitted to the organizer with the registration by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address provided by the player during registration.</p>

<h3>8. Performance of games of skill</h3>
<p>8.1 Only players who have the skill level specified in the match announcement or a lower skill level may participate in the matches.<br> The skill level of a player is determined on a game-by-game basis. It increases and decreases depending on the success of the participant in previous participations in the specific game.<br> When participating for the first time, the player starts with the lowest skill level.(does not apply for wagers)</p>
<p>8.2 In real-time games, a maximum of the number of participants specified in the game announcement will participate at the same time.<br> In the case of certain real-time games, the game will not start until a sufficient number of players have registered for the game. The required number of players is specified in the game announcement. <br>This is indicated to the player by the number of players required and the number of players already registered. Up to the start of the game, the player can revoke his participation in the real-time game at any time.<br> Once the required number of players has been found, the game starts automatically, which is indicated by information on the screen and the transfer of the stake required for money games.<br> The winner of the game is the player who has won the game according to the given game rules. After the end of the game, the winner is notified directly in the game about the outcome of the game and a possible prize. 
<p>8.3 In the case of time-shifted games, each game participant who registers for a game round after the game has been announced will participate.<br> Each individual game participant starts his personal game round immediately after his registration, so that all game participants of the gameplay at different times.<br> Depending on the game type, the player is entitled to repeat or only one game participation. This distinction is tied to whether repeated participation in a game round provides a specific advantage. <br>The number of players specified in the match announcement must participate in the staggered matches. In order to find the necessary players, a validity window is defined for each game offer, in which players can find each other.<br> Once this number of participants has been reached and all players have completed their game round, the game is over and participation is no longer possible.<br> The organizer then determines which game participant has achieved the best result, taking into account the rules of the game.<br> However, the player is able to unsubscribe from this confirmation mail and only view the information online in the "game account".</p>
<p>8.4 By participating in a game for which a fee is charged, the participants in the game make mutual declarations of intent by which a gaming contract is concluded. <br>The organizer is the receiving agent for these declarations of intent of the respective other players. When the number of participants required by the game announcement has been reached, a game contract has been concluded between all participants.<br> According to the concluded game contract, the winner of the game is the one who has achieved the best result according to the game rules specified by the organizer.<br> In the case of a tie in points, the winner is the one who has presented the corresponding score or has been better in other provable game contents.<br>This is described as the "challenge principle". In case of doubt, the organizer has the right to act as referee to determine the winner. </p>
<p>8.5 If - for example, due to a malfunction - the match is not completed in accordance with the rules, the match shall be deemed not to have taken place.<br> The organizer reserves the right to suspend, cancel or postpone the game in whole or in part without prior notice.<br> This applies if the game cannot be played as scheduled for reasons unforeseeable by the organizer and beyond the organizer's control. <br> Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, hardware or software failure, the occurrence of a computer virus or program error, unauthorized third party intervention, and mechanical, technical or legal problems beyond the control and influence of the Promoter.<br> In such cases, players will be refunded any stakes paid.<br> If the cancellation of the game is due to the culpable violation of rules by a game participant, the organizer expressly reserves the right to assert claims, in particular claims for damages. We cannot accept any responsibility for the processing of such personal data by third parties. 

<h3>9. Participation fees and prizes</h3>
<p>9.1 If a participation fee is stated for a match in the invitation to tender, this will be debited from the virtual stake account of the match participant after the player has registered.</p>
<p>9.2 Unless otherwise stated in the game announcement, the winner of a fee-based game receives 90% of the entry fees paid by the entirety of the participating game participants as winnings.<br> 10% of the entry fees shall be paid to the organizer as a handling fee for the organization and processing of the game.</p>
<p>9.3 An attempt will be made to credit the winnings to the player's virtual betting account held with TavernGaming immediately after the result has been determined. <br>If this is not possible directly for technical reasons, the credit will be carried out again and the winnings will be credited within 24 hours at the latest.</p>

<h3>10. General obligations of the players</h3>
<p>10.1 Multiple registrations are not permitted. </p>
<p>10.2 The password for the access-protected area of the organizer’s website must be kept strictly secret by the player and changed at regular intervals (every four weeks at the latest).<br> If the player violates these duties of care and an unauthorized third party makes dispositions based on knowledge of the required password, the player shall be liable for any unauthorized use of his/her password made possible by his/her conduct and the associated use of the gaming platform.<br> As soon as the player becomes aware that his password has become accessible to third parties, he is obliged to change his password immediately.<br> If this is not possible, the organizer must be informed immediately.</p>
<p>10.3 The aforementioned also applies to the transfer of access data to a third party. Passing on access data is generally not permitted and can lead to the blocking of the entire player account.</p>
